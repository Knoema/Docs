# Get Started

Thank you for interest in Knoema.

There are many various ways for developers to utilize Knoema platform for their needs/applications. To get an idea of what can be done we would recommend you to explore our [Apps Gallery](https://knoema.com/apps "Apps Gallery") first. Here you will find a collection of apps utilizing Knoema platform in various ways.

You don’t need to be a developer to get started. We made a number of useful platform features available as ready to use widgets. You can put a dashboard or presentation with any visualization/content you like and then embed it in your site or blog in a few minutes.  Such an approach requires no programming skills at all, just basic understanding of HTML. Refer to Widgets sections for more information on this topic.

Knoema is a truly open platform.  In addition to our own APIs we support several formats widely acknowledged by industry such as [OData](http://www.odata.org/ "") and [SDMX](http://sdmx.org/ "").  If you already have tools/clients utilizing data in these formats you can add Knoema support very easily. More information can be found in Open Data section.

For enthusiasts and hardcore developers Knoema offers extensive Knoema API providing access to all platform capabilities. Start with getting familiar with core Knoema concepts. Then proceed to Applications section to find step-by-step tutorials, detailed documentation and sample apps.
